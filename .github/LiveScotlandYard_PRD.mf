# Project Requirements Document: Live Scotland Yard



## Document Information

- **Project Name**: Live Scotland Yard

- **Version**: 2.0 (Final)

- **Date**: November 20, 2025

- **Status**: Ready for Implementation

- **Change Summary from 1.x**:

  - Added player profiles & local stats

  - Added AI difficulty tiers (Easy/Medium/Hard)

  - Added handicap system with reveal-frequency slider

  - Added dynamic TV focus zoom + possible-location halo

  - Added iOS controller path preview + pinch/drag gestures

  - Added single-player mode (iOS-only)

  - Consolidated naming: iOS app = “Scotland Yard”, tvOS = “Scotland Yard TV”

  - Web prototype first → Swift port path



## 1. Introduction

Digital couch-co-op adaptation of Ravensburger’s Scotland Yard for in-person play using:

- Apple TV as the shared board

- iPhones/iPads as private controllers

- Optional single-player mode on iOS only



## 2. Core Vision

One human or AI Mr. X evades 1–5 human/AI detectives on the classic London map. Detectives cooperate aloud; Mr. X plays in secret. Goal: faithful mechanics + modern polish + family-friendly flexibility.



## 3. Platforms & Distribution

| Target       | App Name               | Bundle ID Example                  | Required |

|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|----------|

| iOS/iPadOS   | Scotland Yard          | com.yourname.scotlandyard          | Yes      |

| tvOS         | Scotland Yard TV       | com.yourname.scotlandyard.tv       | Yes      |

One Xcode project with two targets + shared framework.



## 4. Supported Player Counts

- Minimum: 1 human (solo mode) or 1 Mr. X + 1 detective

- Maximum: 1 Mr. X + 5 detectives (human or AI)

- Bobbies (AI helpers) auto-fill when <4 detectives



## 5. Functional Requirements



### 5.1 Player Profiles & Stats (Local Only)

- On first join: prompt “Enter your name” → stored in Keychain

- Auto-fill on future sessions

- Stats tracked per name:

  - Games played / won (as Mr. X or Detective)

  - Average survival rounds (Mr. X)

  - Capture efficiency

- Post-game leaderboard on TV



### 5.2 Game Setup (Host on tvOS)

| Setting                  | Options / Values                                  | Default          |

|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|

| Timing Mode              | Individual Timed / Commit Mode / Unlimited        | Individual Timed |

| Turn Time                | 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / 90 / 120 s                    | 45 s             |

| AI Fallback on Timeout   | Force AI / Wait Forever                           | Force AI         |

| AI Difficulty (per role) | Off / Easy / Medium / Hard                        | Medium           |

| Handicap: Reveal Freq.   | Slider 1–24 (Mr. X surfaces every N turns)        | 5 (bold)         |

| Extra Detective Tickets  | 0 / +2 / +4 per detective                         | 0                |

| Mr. X Ticket Penalty     | 0 / –2 / –4 total tickets                         | 0                |

| Bobbies                  | Auto / Off                                        | Auto             |



### 5.3 Gameplay Loop

- Standard Scotland Yard rules (24 rounds, surfacing on configured turns, black tickets, double-move tickets)

- Mr. X turn always first, then detectives in any order

- Commit Mode: players tap large “COMMIT” → countdown only starts for last uncommitted player



### 5.4 AI Behavior

- Easy   → greedy / random legal moves

- Medium → basic prediction (ticket clues, block/evade)

- Hard   → minimax-lite depth 3–4, bluffing

- Runs entirely on-device, <500 ms



### 5.5 Single-Player Mode (iOS only)

- Launch → “Play Solo”

- Full-screen map + slide-up Mr. X panel or detective tray

- All other roles filled by AI (difficulty choosable)



## 6. UI/UX Requirements



### 6.1 Apple TV (Shared Board)

- Vector London map (199 nodes)

- Dynamic Focus Zoom:

  - After each Mr. X move → auto pan/zoom to possible-location halo + detective cluster

  - 3-second smooth spring animation

  - Manual override with Siri Remote swipe/pinch

- Tokens pulse on active turn

- HUD: round counter, next reveal, commit status checks, timer ring

- Subtle haptics/sounds only (soft ding on commit, whoosh on move)



### 6.2 iOS Controllers

- Private screen per role

- On turn: glowing path previews limited by available tickets

- Double-move preview chains two hops

- Gestures:

  - 1-finger drag → pan

  - 2-finger pinch → zoom 0.5–3× with inertia

  - Double-tap → reset view

- Large “COMMIT” button in Commit Mode



### 6.3 Accessibility & Polish

- Color-blind line patterns

- VoiceOver labels

- Light haptics package (no annoying sounds)

- Dark-mode friendly



## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- MultipeerConnectivity P2P (tvOS = authoritative server)

- <100 ms sync latency

- Full offline operation

- Local storage only (no iCloud, no accounts)

- App size target <150 MB



## 8. Technical Approach

1. Phase 1 – Web Prototype (HTML/JS/Canvas or React)

   - Validate timing modes, AI, handicaps, commit flow

   - Shareable link for quick playtesting

2. Phase 2 – Port to Swift

   - Core logic from proven open-source repos (MIT licensed Java/Python → Swift structs)

   - Shared framework for GameState, Graph, AI

   - SwiftUI for both targets

3. Phase 3 – Real-device testing → TestFlight → App Store



## 9. Scope (MVP)

Everything listed above + basic polish.



## 10. Out of Scope (MVP)

- Online multiplayer

- Custom maps / NYC variant

- In-app purchases

- Cloud sync

- Advanced neural-net AI



This PRD is now complete and actionable.  

Drop this file into VSCode/Cursor/Claude/Copilot and say “Build this app” — you’ll get a massive head start.



You’re ready to ship the first true modern Scotland Yard couch experience. Go make it real.
